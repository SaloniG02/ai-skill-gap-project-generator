# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Skill-Gap Based Personalized Project Generator is a MERN stack platform that evaluates a developer's programming skills through GitHub analysis and code ingestion to generate personalized learning paths, skill gap maps, and custom project ideas. The system provides task breakdowns, starter code templates, micro-learning recommendations, and continuously updates skill assessments as users progress.

5. WHEN the GitHub_API returns an error, THE System SHALL log the error and return a descriptive message

### Requirement 3: Skill Graph Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a comprehensive map of my programming skills, so that I can understand my strengths and weaknesses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code analysis is complete, THE System SHALL generate a Skill_Graph with scores (0-100) for each detected skill
2. WHEN generating the Skill_Graph, THE System SHALL include categories: Languages, Frameworks, Architecture, Testing, DevOps, Algorithms, Databases
3. WHEN calculating skill scores, THE System SHALL weight recent activity higher than older activity
4. WHEN the Skill_Graph is generated, THE System SHALL store it with a timestamp and version number
5. WHEN the Skill_Graph is updated, THE System SHALL preserve historical versions for progress tracking

### Requirement 4: Skill Gap Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify gaps between my current skills and my target career path, so that I can focus my learning efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies learning goals, THE System SHALL retrieve the target skill profile for that career path
2. WHEN comparing skill profiles, THE System SHALL identify skills where the user scores below 60 as weak skills
3. WHEN comparing skill profiles, THE System SHALL identify required skills with a score of 0 as missing skills
4. WHEN skill gaps are identified, THE System SHALL generate a Skill_Gap_Report ranking gaps by priority
5. WHEN the Skill_Gap_Report is generated, THE System SHALL include recommended learning resources for each gap

### Requirement 5: Personalized Project Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate project ideas tailored to my skill level, so that I can learn through practical application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a project idea, THE System SHALL use the Skill_Graph and Skill_Gap_Report as input to the LLM
2. WHEN generating a project idea, THE System SHALL create a project that addresses 2-4 skill gaps
3. WHEN generating a project idea, THE System SHALL include objective, required skills, technologies, and stretch goals
4. WHEN generating a project idea, THE System SHALL provide justification explaining why the project matches the user's skill state
5. WHEN generating a project idea, THE System SHALL ensure the project scope matches the user's time availability

### Requirement 6: Task Breakdown Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my project broken down into manageable tasks, so that I can make steady progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project idea is generated, THE System SHALL create a Task_Breakdown with 5-20 discrete tasks
2. WHEN creating tasks, THE System SHALL assign a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) to each task
3. WHEN creating tasks, THE System SHALL estimate time required in hours for each task
4. WHEN creating tasks, THE System SHALL order tasks in a logical sequence with dependencies
5. WHEN the Task_Breakdown is complete, THE System SHALL calculate total estimated project duration

### Requirement 7: Code Template Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want starter code and project structure generated for me, so that I can begin coding immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is selected, THE System SHALL generate a complete file structure appropriate for the project type
2. WHEN generating templates, THE System SHALL create boilerplate code for all major components
3. WHEN generating templates, THE System SHALL include configuration files and README with setup instructions
4. WHEN generating templates, THE System SHALL include environment variable templates
5. WHEN templates are generated, THE System SHALL provide the output as a downloadable ZIP file

### Requirement 8: Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to track my progress automatically, so that my skill assessments stay current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their GitHub account, THE System SHALL monitor for new commits on tracked repositories
2. WHEN new commits are detected, THE System SHALL analyze the changes and update the Skill_Graph
3. WHEN the Skill_Graph is updated, THE System SHALL recalculate skill gaps based on the new scores
4. WHEN a user completes a generated project, THE System SHALL mark the project as complete and update relevant skill scores
5. WHEN tracking progress, THE System SHALL sync with GitHub at most once per hour to avoid rate limiting

### Requirement 9: Learning Recommendations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive targeted learning resources, so that I can strengthen weak areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN skill gaps are identified, THE System SHALL generate daily micro-lessons focused on weak concepts
2. WHEN generating micro-lessons, THE System SHALL create content that can be consumed in 5-10 minutes
3. WHEN generating learning materials, THE System SHALL create flashcards for key concepts
4. WHEN a user completes a micro-lesson, THE System SHALL mark it as complete and suggest the next lesson

### Requirement 10: API and Security

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my data protected and accessible via API, so that I can use the platform securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria
